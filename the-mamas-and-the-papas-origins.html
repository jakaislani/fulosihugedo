"I did get hit on the head by a pipe that fell down and my range was increased by three notes." Elliot told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-rolling-stone-interview-cass-elliot-75434/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> in 1968.

Elliot was in love with Doherty, who wasn't interested in her as a romantic partner. Michelle was a believer in free love, so marriage to John didn't keep her from an affair with Doherty (among others).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2007, Michelle recalled the sexual tensions in the group to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/12/phillips200712 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a>, saying, "The four of us would sit around, saying, 'O.K., you're gonna sing the third,' and 'You're gonna do the bop da bops,' and there'd be so much sexual energy between Denny and me that we’d be playing footsie under the table, and Cass and John didn’t notice it." But the liaison eventually came to light.

Why would you take mine?'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John objected to his wife being with his tenor, though at his behest he and Doherty transformed the experience into the co-written "I Saw Her Again" (Doherty sang lead; it was another hit). However, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://people.com/music/rock-love-triangles/?slide=5804751#5804751" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a>, after learning his wife was involved with Gene Clark of the Byrds, John kicked Michelle out of the group and brought in a new "Mama" in the midst of recording the group's second album, The Mamas & the Papas (1966). According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/12/phillips200712 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanity Fair</a>, Michelle fought for her place and eventually returned, thanks in part to fan support.

"I buy them a motorcycle, a leather suit, and put them in acting school." She was married, but it was an arrangement intended to help a friend avoid the draft. In 1967, she gave birth to daughter Owen Elliot-Kugell, but Elliot never publicly named the father.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Elliot may not have found true love, but she had a wide social circle.

"Music happens in my house and that pleases me," she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-rolling-stone-interview-cass-elliot-75434/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a>.

The Mamas & the Papas performed there, but their time together was coming to an end.

She proved her capabilities that year with solo hit "Dream a Little Dream of Me." Her feelings for Doherty remained unrequited and he wasn't interested when she proposed marriage.
