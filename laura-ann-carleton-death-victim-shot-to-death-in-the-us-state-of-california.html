In a dramatic turn of events, a suspect who had reportedly fled the scene on foot was tragically killed by police officers.</p><p>The incident unfolded when law enforcement discovered the individual in close proximity, allegedly still in possession of a weapon. Hollywood director Paul Feig recently took to social media to share a heartfelt tribute to Carleton, describing him as a “wonderful friend.”</p><p>Accompanying his touching words was a photo of the two of them together, capturing a moment of their friendship. According to the police, the suspect allegedly made “derogatory comments” about the rainbow flag prior to shooting the victim.</p><p>The individual was declared deceased at the location. According to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department-Coroner’s Department, deputies were able to locate the suspect who was found to be armed with a handgun.</p><p>In a recent development, it has been reported that an encounter involving deadly force has taken place, resulting in the unfortunate demise of the suspect. Paul Feig, the renowned filmmaker behind hits like Bridesmaids and the beloved TV series Freaks and Geeks, has made a shocking revelation.</p><p>According to Feig, he found himself in a harrowing situation where he was forced to shoot his friend. The incident reportedly occurred after Feig confronted a suspect who was allegedly tearing down a flag.</p><p>In a tragic incident that unfolded in California, a man has been reported to have taken the life of a shopkeeper following a heated exchange over the display of the Pride flag. The incident, which occurred recently, has sent shockwaves through the local community.</p><p>In a recent Instagram post, he expressed his profound sorrow for the family of Ms. Carleton and the LGBTQ+ community, emphasising that Lauri was a genuine ally to them. In a written statement, he expressed a strong desire for an end to the prevailing intolerance.</p><p>In a powerful statement, it has been emphasised that individuals who engage in hate speech targeting the LGBTQ+ community must recognise the significant impact of their words. It is crucial for them to understand that their words possess the potential to incite violence against innocent individuals whom they hold dear.</p><p>According to a local Lake Arrowhead LGBT group, the incident has been described as a “very sad day” for the community. They expressed their deep sorrow over the loss of Ms. Carleton, who was regarded as a “friend and supporter,” and stated that she will be greatly missed.</p><p>According to a statement posted on their Instagram account, the group reported that she lost her life while protecting her LGBTQ+ Pride flags displayed outside her store. Lauri, although not identifying as LGBTQ+, devoted his time to assisting and championing individuals within the community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7y5qsq5ldlruvecKaqaWdpKS7brDEmquhZaaesLW1zGaqoaekYsGwecOemK2gXZ67bsDHnmSuq12owaLAxGamn2WTlrmqss6rpaKZXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flaura-ann-carleton-death-victim-shot-to-death-in-the-us-state-of-california.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flaura-ann-carleton-death-victim-shot-to-death-in-the-us-state-of-california.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flaura-ann-carleton-death-victim-shot-to-death-in-the-us-state-of-california.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flaura-ann-carleton-death-victim-shot-to-death-in-the-us-state-of-california.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flaura-ann-carleton-death-victim-shot-to-death-in-the-us-state-of-california.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flaura-ann-carleton-death-victim-shot-to-death-in-the-us-state-of-california.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./peanut-butter-cup-cheesecake-fudge.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./peanut-butter-cup-cheesecake-fudge.html>Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake Fudge</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-is-kelly-clarksons-net-worth-in-2023.html>How Much is Kelly Clarksons Net Worth in 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-much-is-kelly-clarksons-net-worth-in-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
