The couple, who share two children, have moved on from their difficult past and now amicably co-parent their kids.</p><p class=dh>Tiger Woods will go down in history as one of the most iconic golfers the world has ever seen, thanks to his talent, multiple championships, and records.</p><p class=dh>For instance, he has won 82 PGA Tours, which ties him first all-time in golf history. He also ranks second in men's major championships and holds several golf records.</p><p class=dh>Thanks to his golfing prowess, he is regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time. He is also one of the greatest sportsmen in history and is an inductee of the World Golf Hall of Fame.</p><p class=dh>While Woods' talent and iconic status in the golf world are unquestionable, it is in his personal life that he has struggled.</p><p class=dh>In 2009, the golfer was enmeshed in multiple cheating scandals that almost ended his career and led to the end of his marriage with <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/5976239/tiger-woods-elin-nordegren-ex-wife/>Elin Nordegren</a>.

Before venturing into modeling, she and her twin sister Josefin worked odd jobs in supermarkets to fund their education. At 20, she began her modeling career and appeared on the cover of Cafe Sport magazine in the summer of 2000.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren met Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik's wife Mia Parnevik while working in a clothes shop in Stockholm. Jesper and Mia then hired her to be their kids' nanny.</p><p class=dh>Due to the job, Nordegren moved with them to the United States. In 2001, she met Woods at the 2001 Open Championship. Before their meeting, Woods had spent a year begging Mia to introduce him to Nordegren. However, she was seeing someone at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/d0a34b3a5ec0e2db07095ff62db81006.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tiger Woods, his daugher Sam, and his wife Elin Nordegren at Stanford Stadium on November 21, 2009. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In November 2003, Woods and Nordegren attended the President's Cup tournament in South Africa. Afterward, he proposed to her at the Shamwari Game Reserve.</p><p class=dh>On October 5, 2004, the couple tied the knot at the Sandy Lane Resort in Barbados. After their marriage, they lived at Isleworth, Windermere, Orlando, Florida. The couple welcomed their daughter, Sam Alexis, in 2007. In 2009, their son Charlie Axel was born.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WOODS' CHEATING SCANDAL</strong></p><p class=dh>Woods was at the peak of his career in 2009. On October 1, 2009, Forbes named him the first athlete to earn $1 billion. His status as one of the sport's greatest athletes was strong.</p><p class=dh>His family life also seemed to be perfect. He had a beautiful wife and two adorable kids. The golfer also had multiple endorsement deals, and all seemed to be going well.</p><p class=dh>However, on November 25, 2009, the National Enquirer published a story claiming Woods had an extramarital affair with Rachel Uchitel, a New York City nightclub manager.</p><p class=dh>However, a day before the tabloid hit the stands, Woods put Nordegren on the phone with Uchitel, who insisted the rumors were false. The women spoke for 30 minutes.</p><p class=dh>After the call, Woods was satisfied, but his wife was not. Later that afternoon, she scrolled through his phone's call history and found the name of another woman, Jaimee Grubbs.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren called the woman's number, but it went into voice mail. She left a message to the woman telling her she knew she was sleeping with her husband.</p><p class=dh>However, Nordegren did not tell Woods what she had done. When he got hold of his phone, he also called Grubbs and begged her to take his name off her phone because his wife had gone through his phone and was suspicious.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren did not say anything for the next two days. However, after reading the Enquirer's story about Woods' cheating scandal, she was shocked by the revelations.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Woods' children have been a major part of him bouncing back to the top of his career.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/59a2d7a0f6ace0c06721a0afa787d2a4.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tiger Woods' reaction after chipping in from the bunker on the third hole during the final round of The PLAYERS Championship at TPC Sawgrass on March 17, 2019. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>On November 26, 2009, Woods and Nordegren hosted his mom at their mansion in Windermere for Thanksgiving. That night, Woods fell asleep after taking an Ambien, and his wife took his phone and searched for Uchitel's number.</p><p class=dh>She found a romantic message from her husband to Uchitel in which he professed love to her. She pretended to be Woods and chatted with Uchitel to ensure they were seeing each other.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren found out the truth and called Uchitel, who realized what was happening and hung up. Nordegren was angered by what was happening and screamed.</p><p class=dh>Her screams woke Woods, who grabbed his phone and ran to the bathroom, locking himself up. He texted Uchitel and told her what had happened. He also told her it looked like divorce.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren continued yelling at Woods and demanded he come out. When he emerged, she swiped his cellphone and saw the text he sent to Uchitel about divorce and got angrier.</p><p class=dh>She threw the phone at Woods, chipping his tooth. She then tried to attack him physically, but he freed himself from her and ran away.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren grabbed a golf club and chased after Woods. He hopped into his 2009 Escalade and zoomed off while she entered a golf cart and chased after him.</p><p class=dh>Woods collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges near his home. Another couple in the neighborhood rushed to the crash scene and saw Nordegren with the golf club and the Escalade's two black windows smashed out.</p><p class=dh>Nordegren asked the couple for help in pulling her husband out. When authorities arrived, she told them it was a simple car accident.</p><p class=dh>Woods was treated for his injuries and received a ticket for careless driving. However, media speculation about the accident intensified.</p><p class=dh>The golfer did his best to douse the tension by claiming sole responsibility for the crash and crediting his wife for helping him from the car.</p><p class=dh>However, the cheating <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2013/11/24/the-night-tiger-woods-was-exposed-as-a-serial-cheater/>scandal</a> intensified, and Uchitel scheduled a press conference. The conference got canceled with reports circulating that Woods paid her $10 million to keep quiet.</p><p class=dh>The golfer would not have expected what followed as multiple women came forward claiming to have had sex with him. Two weeks after the accident, 14 women had claimed to have slept with him.</p><p class=dh>Woods lost many of his endorsements as many of the world's biggest brands cut ties with him. He also announced he was taking a leave from golf and entered rehab for sex addiction at the end of December.</p><p class=dh>Woods also released statements admitting to the cheating scandals and apologized to his fans. He reportedly confessed to sleeping with 120 women.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WOODS AND NORDEGREN'S DIVORCE</strong></p><p class=dh>Woods and Nordegren's marriage ended in divorce after the cheating scandal.
