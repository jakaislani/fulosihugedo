You’ve got a whole new playground in which to win or lose money; you can get drunk on the most expensive liquor known to man. There are new clothes for you to fritter away your chips on, there’s art for your new home, and there’s the chance to fork out a truckload on wonga on a penthouse suite. But the question remains, should you?</p><p data-injection=true>After all, it isn’t cheap and if you’ve got all the other places you can call home then is there any need for it? The answer to this is yes as by purchasing this monumentally expensive pad you unlock a host of new missions. What follows is a guide to the six that are available and what you’ll need to do to complete them.</p><h2>GTA Online: Casino Missions Guide</h2><p><img decoding=async alt="Loose Cheng" data-entity-type data-entity-uuid src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/guides/gta-online-casino-missions style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Loose Cheng</h3><p data-injection=true>Everything starts after you’ve parted with your ill-gotten gains for the suite. Agatha Baker contacts you and tells you that the Duggan Family are trying to make a hostile takeover of the casino and to do this they’ve organized the kidnapping of the not exactly squeaky clean owner, Tao Cheng, by the Lost MC. Your mission, if you should choose to accept it, is to head over to the Derelict Motel out in Sandy Shores and wipe out every member of the Motorcycle gang that you find there, rescue Cheng, and bring him back alive. A job made all that harder by the fact the Lost MC will hunt you down the second you make a break for it.</p><p><img decoding=async alt=Housekeeping data-entity-type data-entity-uuid src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/guides/gta-online-casino-missions style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Housekeeping</h3><p data-injection=true>Having dealt with the Lost MC and returned Mr. Cheng to the safety of his casino, you’d think that that would be the end of the Duggan’s meddling. You would, of course, be wrong. It turns out that them pesky Duggan’s have been paying people to cause trouble at the resort by starting fights and when this happens you’re on hand to knock them out. Unfortunately, you miss one, and they make off with the Thrax that’s sat on the podium waiting to be won. What you have to do is get it back. Simple enough, right? Just make sure that it doesn’t get destroyed though because if it does, then it’s game over.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Strong Arm Tactics" data-entity-type data-entity-uuid src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/guides/gta-online-casino-missions style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Strong Arm Tactics</h3><p data-injection=true>Seemingly growing tired of you kicking his arse for the past couple of missions, Avery Duggan decides that he wants a sit down with Cheng to discuss him buying the casino outright. You, along with Cheng and Cheng’s translator, go to the meet and listen to what Duggan has to say. Everything goes south when Cheng refuses to sell up and, instead, pulls a gun on Avery, setting in motion a Mexican stand-off without any Mexican’s. All you have to do is kill everyone and make sure that neither Cheng or his translator gets whacked as you try to make your way to the Pacific Bluffs Country Club, with more of Duggan’s men in hot pursuit.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Play To Win" data-entity-type data-entity-uuid src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/guides/gta-online-casino-missions style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Play To Win</h3><p data-injection=true>If you’ve played any of the destroy missions in GTA Online, then you’ll know what a massive pain in the ass they are. So good news, everyone! Play To Win is the ultimate destroy mission and will cause your head to explode with rage as you fail time and again. Now that Cheng and the Duggan’s are at war you’re tasked with hunting down four of Avery’s oil tankers and blowing them up. This is made harder by the fact that you have to deal with an army that has no intention of letting you even put a scratch in these things, let alone explode them, but as soon as all four tankers are destroyed, it’s onto the next mission. Nope, nuh-huh, not a chance. When you thought it was all over; you get a phone call telling you to head to the Los Santos State Gas Company where you’ll find five more waiting for you, along with enough fire-power to wipe out half of the human race. So, yeah, good luck with that.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Bad Beat" data-entity-type data-entity-uuid src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/guides/gta-online-casino-missions style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Bad Beat</h3><p data-injection=true>If you haven’t rage quit after the Play To Win mission, then the next one up is Bad Beat. While the gang is trying to figure out what their next move should be, Avery’s nephew, Thornton, shows up and claims that he comes in peace, having had a falling out with his uncle. He proves this by letting you know that Avery has sent a ton of mercenaries to attack the casino and it’s up to you and your crew to stop them from succeeding. You do this the same way you do everything in GTA Online by murdering the blue hell out of any bad guys you find.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Cashing Out" data-entity-type data-entity-uuid src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/guides/gta-online-casino-missions style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Cashing Out</h3><p>If you’ve managed to make it this far without dying or just throwing a fit and vowing never to play GTA Online again, then you’ll be glad to know that Cashing Out is the final casino mission. And being the final casino mission, it’s a doozy. Cheng’s uncle has told them to sell the place as he’s tired of all the bad publicity that’s coming from the wake of bodies that you’re leaving behind you. Understandably nobody wants to sell it to Avery as he’s a d**k, but his nephew doesn’t have the cash and the only way he can get it is if someone shuffles his uncle off this mortal coil. That, as always, is where you come in. You can do this mission, either way, be sneaky and stealth everyone to death or be loud and rain down hellfire upon your foes. Though if you take the latter route then things aren’t going to end well for you as you’ll have helicopters and all sorts of nasty stuff trying to end your life. Be successful, and you’ll complete the GTA Online casino missions and will get the Enus Paragon Armored Car for your troubles as well as a nice chunk of change and RP.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4042f2a145c12f04bd300cda937ebf94?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Neil Gray</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc></p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Neil Gray</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZLS1rYyopaWhnpp6pK3SoqWoZZ2ewLS1zqeq</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgta-online-casino-missions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgta-online-casino-missions.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgta-online-casino-missions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgta-online-casino-missions.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgta-online-casino-missions.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgta-online-casino-missions.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ryan-dunn-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ryan-dunn-net-worth-2024.html>Ryan Dunn Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gail-mabalane-shares-inspirational-post-as-she-ushers-her-fans-into-the-new-month.html>Gail Mabalane Shares Inspirational Post As She Ushers Her Fans Into The New Month</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gail-mabalane-shares-inspirational-post-as-she-ushers-her-fans-into-the-new-month.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
