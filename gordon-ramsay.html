By the early 2000s, he was making his mark on British TV as the temperamental host of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and Hell’s Kitchen, shows that made a successful transition to American audiences. The award-winning chef has since expanded his celebrity brand via such programs as MasterChef and Hotel Hell and opening more restaurants around the globe.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gordon James Ramsay was born on November 8, 1966, in Johnstone, Scotland and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, after he moved there with his family at the age of 5. Ramsay's first love was soccer, and he set his sights on a professional sports career. At the age of 15, the talented Ramsay joined the Glasgow Rangers, a pro club.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His time with the team spanned three years, until 1985 when a knee injury prematurely ended his career. Forced to start over, Ramsay returned to school, earning a degree in hotel management in 1987.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Top Chef and Entrepreneur</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After finishing his studies, Ramsay placed himself under the direction of some of Europe's top chefs. He apprenticed with Marco Pierre White at Harvey's in London, worked for Albert Roux at Le Gavroche, and then worked under master chefs Joel Robuchon and Guy Savoy in France.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1993, Ramsay struck out on his own as head chef of the newly opened Aubergine in London where, over the course of three years, he earned the restaurant a two-star rating from Michelin. More personal prestige followed in 1995 when Ramsay was awarded Newcomer of the Year at the prestigious Catey Awards, an Oscars-like event for the restaurant and hotel business.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the restaurant's financial backing became shaky, Ramsay left Aubergine and opened his own establishment, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, in 1998 in London. Hailed as a destination for high-end foodies, the restaurant eventually received a three-star rating from Michelin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The next several years proved to be a whirlwind for the ambitious, hard-driving and temperamental Ramsay. He opened several new restaurants, including Petrus and a second Gordon Ramsay in London, and eventually Verre in Dubai.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Named Chef of the Year at the 2000 Catey Awards and Independent Restaurateur of the Year in 2006, Ramsay brought his restaurant business to the U.S. in 2006 with the opening of two establishments at The London NYC. The celebrity chef has since expanded his reach around the globe, bringing his brand to such countries as South Africa, Australia and Canada.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Television Star</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ramsay's migration to television began in 1996 with his appearance as a judge on the BBC competitive cooking show MasterChef. In 1999, he was the focus of a British documentary miniseries, Boiling Point, which tracked his working life as he opened his first restaurant. The success of that documentary spawned a follow-up miniseries, Beyond Boiling Point, in 2000.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ramsey was tapped to host two programs in the spring of 2004: In Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, he sought to turn around failing restaurants, and in Hell’s Kitchen, he ran a cooking competition among 10 celebrities, with audiences voting off contestants.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With reality television in full bloom in the U.S., the time was ripe for Ramsay to make his move across the Atlantic. In May 2005, an American version of Hell's Kitchen, which placed aspiring restaurateurs under the intense eye of the show's host, debuted on FOX. Like their British counterparts, American audiences learned to love and hate the abrasive chef as he narrowed the field of participants down to one final winner. Meanwhile, he launched another culinary series back in the U.K., The F Word.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ramsay’s strong ratings on U.S. screens opened the door for an adaptation of Kitchen Nightmares, which debuted in September 2007. That, in turn, led to the American productions of MasterChef (2010) and MasterChef Junior (2013), with Ramsay heading the group of judges. In 2012, he added another show to his schedule, a variation of his “save a failing establishment” theme with Hotel Hell.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Outside the Kitchen</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with his work on TV and in his restaurants, Ramsay has written more than 20 books. His various businesses have been consolidated into Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Honored for his impressive record of achievement, Ramsay was named Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2006. In 2013, he was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ramsay married schoolteacher Cayetana Elizabeth "Tana" Hutcheson in 1996. They have five children: Megan, twins Holly and Jack, Matilda and Oscar. In 2014, the couple established the Gordon and Tana Ramsay Foundation to help support the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Gordon Ramsay</li><li>Birth Year: 1966</li><li>Birth date: November 8, 1966</li><li>Birth City: Johnstone</li><li>Birth Country: Scotland</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Scottish celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has opened restaurants around the world and hosted such popular TV programs as ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ and ‘MasterChef.’</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Television</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Nacionalities</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Scot (Scotland)</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Gordon Ramsay Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/gordon-ramsay</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: May 12, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 3, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVonqiqlKS7br7ApqqasQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgordon-ramsay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgordon-ramsay.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgordon-ramsay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgordon-ramsay.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgordon-ramsay.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgordon-ramsay.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joseph-miceli-obituary-new-jersey-joseph-miceli-has-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joseph-miceli-obituary-new-jersey-joseph-miceli-has-died.html>Joseph Miceli Obituary New Jersey, Joseph Miceli Has Died</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./georgia-named-9th-worst-state-raise-family-new-study-finds.html>Georgia 9th worst state to raise family, WalletHub says</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./georgia-named-9th-worst-state-raise-family-new-study-finds.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
